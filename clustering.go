	// Next, we connect each cell on the distance matrix to its K most similar cells using Leiden.

	// The KNN graph reflects the underlying topology of the expression data by representing dense regions with respect to expression space also as densely connected regions in the graph

	// The starting point is a singleton partition in which each node functions as its own community (a).
	// As a next step, the algorithm creates partitions by moving individual nodes from one community to another (b), which is refined afterwards to enhance the partitioning (c).
	// The refined partition is then aggregated to a network (d).
	// Subsequently, the algorithm moves again individual nodes in the aggregate network (e), until refinement does no longer change the partition (f).
	// All steps are repeated until the final clustering is created and partitions no longer change.

	// g := BuildKNNGraph(pcs, k)
	// un leiden clustering on the graph
	// communities := g.Leiden()

	// return communities
